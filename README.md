# Casting Defects API

Given an image of a casting, the API will predict whether it is defective.  The model development detail is given [here](https://github.com/NickPTaylor/kaggle-casting-defects) in a series of Jupyter notebooks.  In particular, the source code for this API is based on [this](https://github.com/NickPTaylor/kaggle-casting-defects/tree/master/source/casting_defects_model).  The data set was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product).
